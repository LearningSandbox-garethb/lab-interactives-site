## Details on the initial setup for development

The readme contains the following steps for initial setup:

1. Clone the git repository
2. `cd lab-interactives-site`
3. `make everything`
4. open another new terminal and run `rackup config.ru`
5. open http://localhost:9292
6. (optional) open a new terminal and run `guard`
7. (optional) `cp -vn script/post-commit .git/hooks/`

### 1. Clone the git repository

Use git to create a local clone of the Lab repository.
If you aren't familiar with git, you should read one of the tutorials on it.

If you have commit access to the repository use this form:</p>

    git clone git@github.com:concord-consortium/lab-interactives-site.git

Alternatively if you donâ€™t have commit access use this form:

    git clone git://github.com/concord-consortium/lab-interactives-site.git

### 2. `cd lab-interactives-site`

Open a shell and change to the `lab-interactives-site/` directory. The first time you `cd` into
the `lab-interactives-site/` directory RVM will switch to using `ruby-2.0.0-p247` based on the
`.ruby-version` file in the repository.
Additionally the `.ruby-gemset` tells RVM to install the gems in a gemset named `lab`. So together
these files tell RVM to store and load gems from the `ruby-2.0.0-p247@lab` gemset.

If you don't have `ruby-2.0.0-p247` already installed rvm will display the command you need to
run to install it. Run this command if required.

If you do end up having to install a new version of Ruby with RVM change out of and back into the lab directory after the RVM install of Ruby is complete:

    cd ..; cd lab

### 3. `make everything`

This will download and install all the dependencies and build the whole project for the first time.
When `make everything` is run on a freshly cloned repository it performs the following tasks:

1.  Install the runtime dependencies as git submodules into the `vendor/` directory:

        git submodule update --init --recursive

2.  Install the development dependencies that use [nodejs](http://nodejs.org/) and
    are managed by [npm](http://npmjs.org/):

        npm install

    You can see the list of dependencies to be installed in the file `package.json`. In addition
    `vendor/d3` and `vendor/science.js` are manually installed into `node_modules/`.

3.  Install the additional RubyGems used for development: haml, sass, guard ...

        bundle install

4.  Generates the `public` directory:

You should now be able to open the file: `public/index.html` in a browser however most things won't work correctly.
This is because of the limitation of the `file` protocol in browsers. Continue on to see about setting up the server.

### 4. open another new terminal and run `rackup config.ru`

Startup the Rack-based Lab server for local development. This is simple rack application that mainly just serves the files in public.

Alternatively you can use `python -m SimpleHTTPServer` to run a python server. Currently it won't handle the applets and it won't support snapshots, but you might not need those features.

### 5. open http://localhost:9292

Now that the files in public are built and a server is running you can view the Lab site locally.

### 6. (optional) open a new terminal and run `guard`

Start watching the `src/` and `test/` directories with [Guard](dependencies.md#guard) and when files are
changed automatically generate the JavaScript Lab modules, the examples, and run the tests.

Now any change you make in `src/examples/` will generate the corresponding content in `public/examples/`.
In addition changes in `src/lab/` generate the associated Lab modules in `lab/` and copy these modules
to `public/lab/`. In addition any change in either the `src/lab/` or `test/`directories will run the
tests and display the results in the console window where `guard`
is running.

This is optional because you can also just manually run `make` after making changes.
